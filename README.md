## About:
The main goal is to make it easy all knowlegde about how to calculate those fees and display a forecast in case of late payments.

I had this idea when I was working for a bank in a call center, supporting clients with their needs about credit cards. 

One of them asked me how much money he would pay if the payment was late. I hadn't the answer because at that moment I didn't even know how to calculate it and the company
didn't have any system to do that.

Then I decided to learn all about credit card fees and build the application on excel and then coding it.

## How to use:

- First is necessary write your name;
- Choose an option to pay: minimun payment or late payment;
- The icon " i " gives informations about each one;
- Then, fill all blank spaces to simulate. If not, an alert will be displayed;

There's a rule about minimun paymebts:
It is necessary at least 15% of payment. If not modal will appear to inform the right value.
